# DATA ANALYSIS OF 50 STARTUPS AND FINDING OUT THE VARIABLES OF THAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT FOR PROFITS
(This is my personal project to learn more about multiple Linear Regression and about model complexity.)

Developed a solution to analyze the significant variables which have the most impact on the profit margins of the startups by using exploratory data analysis and making profit prediction models using multiple linear regression.

Python Libraries used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Seaborn, StatsModel
